# Gregbueno.com Wordpress

Gregbueno.com Wordpress is the Wordpress installation that powers retired blogs hosted on [gregbueno.com](http://gregbueno.com/).

## History

A series of blogs and an online journal were previously powered by Movable Type. When Movable Type retired its open source version, the content of those blogs were migrated to WordPress.

The blogs are no longer updated but remain online.

## About this repository

The repository contains the full installation of Wordpress alongside third-party plugins and my own customizations (themes, plugins, etc.).

Content of the uploads directory is excluded, as well as the ``wp-config.php`` file.

Updates to Wordpress are pulled from the Wordpress Github repo and pushed here. Plugin updates are also reflected in this repo.

## Customizations

### Bootstrap Overrides

[Bootstrap Overrides](https://bitbucket.org/NemesisVex/bootstrap-overrides-for-wordpress) allow comment forms and pagination links to use Bootstrap styles.
